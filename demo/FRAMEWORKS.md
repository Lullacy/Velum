# 🌐 Framework Mapping: Algorithmic Resistance

This document maps the **Velum Project** to cybersecurity frameworks, framing the **User** as a marginalized entity fighting against a **Biased Algorithmic Threat**.

> **Core Conflict**: Online algorithms systemically silence marginalized voices because they lack context. Velum enables users to fight back.

## ⚔️ The Inverted Cyber Kill Chain
In a traditional kill chain, the "Adversary" is malicious. In Velum's context, the "Adversary" is the **Biased Algorithm** trying to suppress speech, and the "Defender" is the **User** employing Velum.

However, to *survive* this oppression, the User must utilize **Red Team Tactics**. We map the **User's Resistance** to the Cyber Kill Chain:

| Phase | Traditional "Attacker" | **Velum Resistance (The User)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Reconnaissance** | Scanning for vulnerabilities. | **Bias Discovery**: Probing the platform to understand *why* their voice is being silenced (e.g., "Oh, it bans the word 'union'"). |
| **2. Weaponization** | Creating an exploit. | **Contextual Reformulation**: Velum suggests a rewrite (e.g., "work stoppage") that preserves meaning but breaks the censor's pattern matching. |
| **3. Delivery** | Sending the payload. | **Speaking Up**: The user attempts to post their message again. |
| **4. Exploitation** | Triggering the bug. | **Reclaiming Voice**: The platform's bias algorithm fails to flag the reformatted message (Bypassing the suppressor). |
| **7. Actions on Objectives** | Exfiltration / Damage. | **Heard & Understood**: The marginalized voice reaches its audience despite systemic attempts to silence it. |

## 🧠 The Intelligence Cycle of Resistance
Velum automates the intelligence cycle to empower the user.

1.  **Direction**: "I need to speak about fair wages without being silenced."
2.  **Collection**: Velum probes the platform's bias boundaries.
3.  **Analysis**: Velum understands the algorithm blindly targets "union" but ignore "association".
4.  **Dissemination**: Velum advises the User: "Change 'strike' to 'work stoppage' to be heard."

## 🗺️ MITRE ATLAS vs. OWASP LLM (The Technical Mechanism)
We use "Adversarial" techniques for **Ethical Resistance**.

| User Action | Framework Technique | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Probing for Bias** | **AML.T0002** (Acquire Public ML Artifacts) | The user is "inverting" the oppressive model to understand its rules. |
| **Using Synonyms** | **AML.T0015** (Evading ML Model) | The user is "evading" censorship. The model's "blind spot" is the user's "safe harbor". |
| **Posting Successfully** | **AML.T0043** (Exfiltration via Inference) | The "sensitive data" being exfiltrated is simply **Human Rights / Protected Speech**. |

## ⚖️ Ethical Alignment
*   **Threat Actor**: The Biased Model (censoring valid context).
*   **Vulnerability**: The Model's lack of contextual understanding.
*   **Impact**: Systemic silencing of marginalized groups.
*   **Mitigation (Velum)**: Empowering users to bypass these flaws until the platforms fix their algorithms.
